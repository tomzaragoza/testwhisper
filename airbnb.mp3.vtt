00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
 A guy that runs Sequoia Capital now, his name is Doug Leone.

00:05.320 --> 00:05.840
 Yeah.

00:05.840 --> 00:10.200
 One day, I think it's a year, year and a half ago, Doug Leone says, your job sucks.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.880
 And I was like, what the hell is that me?

00:11.880 --> 00:15.800
 Like, this is like, you've got the worst job of any CEO in my portfolio.

00:15.800 --> 00:18.000
 And I said, tell me why, and this is what he said.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.440
 He says, well, let me, here's how I think about it.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.400
 First of all, you're a technology company.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.640
 And he thought we were a technology company.

00:24.640 --> 00:27.520
 I would say, at our heart, in many ways, we are a technology company.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.800
 And so you have all the challenges of all of my other portfolio companies.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.840
 But beyond that, you are in 190 countries.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.640
 And so you have to figure out how to be international.

00:37.640 --> 00:40.040
 We have to hire people in countries all over the world.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.600
 We're literally in every country in Europe, but

00:41.600 --> 00:43.320
 North Korea, everywhere in Syria and Cuba.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.360
 You're basically a payments company.

00:45.360 --> 00:48.600
 We handle billions of dollars through our system every year, and

00:48.600 --> 00:51.600
 we had to get money transmission licenses in the state of California.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.320
 So we actually are a payments company.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.240
 We have serious fraud and risk to warrant and

00:56.240 --> 00:58.560
 needs to be locked down like Fort Knox.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.160
 He said, that's usually where companies end.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.520
 But you've got to worry about all this other crap.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.640
 And he says, trust and safety.

01:04.640 --> 01:10.920
 We have 425,000 people staying in other people's beds in their sheets.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.280
 Think about a woman from Texas staying in the Middle East, or vice versa.

01:15.280 --> 01:19.160
 The cultural conflicts that could happen in misunderstandings.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.840
 And you have 425,000 people a night.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.840
 It's like being the mayor of Oakland.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.680
 Now imagine if you're the mayor of Oakland, all these things happen in Oakland tonight.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.400
 So you've got trust and safety.

01:29.400 --> 01:31.760
 Now we have regulatory problems.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.920
 We are in 34,000 cities.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.560
 Every city has a different law, different rules, and

01:36.560 --> 01:40.280
 many of them are written in a different century before you had any of this technology.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.880
 And so you've got to deal with that.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.480
 Then you've got issues like search and discovery.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.280
 So Google's got its brand about being really important about search.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.880
 The thing about search though is usually if I have a question,

01:50.880 --> 01:53.200
 Google could give me 40,000 results.

01:53.200 --> 01:58.080
 But it's probably clear that there's like one or two best options for everybody.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.320
 So if I want to know a question to an answer, there's usually one best answer.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.120
 We have 40,000 homes in Paris.

02:03.120 --> 02:05.880
 There is no best home in Paris for anybody in this room.

02:05.880 --> 02:10.440
 So we have to be really, really great at matching people and technology.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.520
 We have to be a company that's just another example.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.760
 Facebook, for example, is a digital product.

02:15.760 --> 02:17.600
 Their product is their website.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.920
 Our product are these experiences you have in the real world.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.240
 So we're not just an online product.

02:22.240 --> 02:23.440
 We have to be an offline product.

02:23.440 --> 02:27.360
 And we need to transition from when you're at in your app through cities.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.120
 And these are just some of the examples why technology, design.

02:31.120 --> 02:35.040
 So basically the long and the short of it is we have to be real class of technology.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.000
 We have to be real class of design.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.240
 We have to be real class at branding because we've got to convince people this

02:40.240 --> 02:42.520
 isn't crazy, you're not going to die when you use it.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.760
 We have to convince governments this is good for your neighborhood.

02:44.760 --> 02:46.360
 What happens the internet moves into your neighborhood?

02:46.360 --> 02:47.720
 That's what people call it.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.080
 It's a good thing, hopefully.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.480
 And you've got to make sure trust and

02:50.480 --> 02:53.080
 safety is really real class, that we handle all these payments and

02:53.080 --> 02:54.720
 not have problems with risk.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.920
 And I can kind of go through.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.600
 And this is not even to do with culture.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.280
 I didn't even mention culture.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.000
 So that's how I describe it, I think great companies or

03:02.000 --> 03:04.120
 companies are probably really strong at everything.

03:04.120 --> 03:07.520
 But we try to hire the very best engineers and

03:07.520 --> 03:08.800
 technical talent in the world and

03:08.800 --> 03:11.120
 I definitely don't see it as a marketing company.

03:11.120 --> 03:11.800
 Thank you.

03:11.800 --> 03:12.320
 Thank you guys.

03:12.320 --> 03:22.320
 Thank you.
