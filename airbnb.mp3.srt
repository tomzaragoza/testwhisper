1
0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:05.320
A guy that runs Sequoia Capital now, his name is Doug Leone.

2
0:00:05.320 --> 0:00:05.840
Yeah.

3
0:00:05.840 --> 0:00:10.200
One day, I think it's a year, year and a half ago, Doug Leone says, your job sucks.

4
0:00:10.200 --> 0:00:11.880
And I was like, what the hell is that me?

5
0:00:11.880 --> 0:00:15.800
Like, this is like, you've got the worst job of any CEO in my portfolio.

6
0:00:15.800 --> 0:00:18.000
And I said, tell me why, and this is what he said.

7
0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:21.440
He says, well, let me, here's how I think about it.

8
0:00:21.440 --> 0:00:23.400
First of all, you're a technology company.

9
0:00:23.400 --> 0:00:24.640
And he thought we were a technology company.

10
0:00:24.640 --> 0:00:27.520
I would say, at our heart, in many ways, we are a technology company.

11
0:00:27.520 --> 0:00:31.800
And so you have all the challenges of all of my other portfolio companies.

12
0:00:31.800 --> 0:00:35.840
But beyond that, you are in 190 countries.

13
0:00:35.840 --> 0:00:37.640
And so you have to figure out how to be international.

14
0:00:37.640 --> 0:00:40.040
We have to hire people in countries all over the world.

15
0:00:40.040 --> 0:00:41.600
We're literally in every country in Europe, but

16
0:00:41.600 --> 0:00:43.320
North Korea, everywhere in Syria and Cuba.

17
0:00:43.320 --> 0:00:45.360
You're basically a payments company.

18
0:00:45.360 --> 0:00:48.600
We handle billions of dollars through our system every year, and

19
0:00:48.600 --> 0:00:51.600
we had to get money transmission licenses in the state of California.

20
0:00:51.600 --> 0:00:53.320
So we actually are a payments company.

21
0:00:53.320 --> 0:00:56.240
We have serious fraud and risk to warrant and

22
0:00:56.240 --> 0:00:58.560
needs to be locked down like Fort Knox.

23
0:00:58.560 --> 0:01:01.160
He said, that's usually where companies end.

24
0:01:01.160 --> 0:01:02.520
But you've got to worry about all this other crap.

25
0:01:02.520 --> 0:01:04.640
And he says, trust and safety.

26
0:01:04.640 --> 0:01:10.920
We have 425,000 people staying in other people's beds in their sheets.

27
0:01:10.920 --> 0:01:15.280
Think about a woman from Texas staying in the Middle East, or vice versa.

28
0:01:15.280 --> 0:01:19.160
The cultural conflicts that could happen in misunderstandings.

29
0:01:19.160 --> 0:01:21.840
And you have 425,000 people a night.

30
0:01:21.840 --> 0:01:23.840
It's like being the mayor of Oakland.

31
0:01:23.840 --> 0:01:27.680
Now imagine if you're the mayor of Oakland, all these things happen in Oakland tonight.

32
0:01:27.680 --> 0:01:29.400
So you've got trust and safety.

33
0:01:29.400 --> 0:01:31.760
Now we have regulatory problems.

34
0:01:31.760 --> 0:01:33.920
We are in 34,000 cities.

35
0:01:33.920 --> 0:01:36.560
Every city has a different law, different rules, and

36
0:01:36.560 --> 0:01:40.280
many of them are written in a different century before you had any of this technology.

37
0:01:40.280 --> 0:01:41.880
And so you've got to deal with that.

38
0:01:41.880 --> 0:01:44.480
Then you've got issues like search and discovery.

39
0:01:44.480 --> 0:01:47.280
So Google's got its brand about being really important about search.

40
0:01:47.280 --> 0:01:50.880
The thing about search though is usually if I have a question,

41
0:01:50.880 --> 0:01:53.200
Google could give me 40,000 results.

42
0:01:53.200 --> 0:01:58.080
But it's probably clear that there's like one or two best options for everybody.

43
0:01:58.080 --> 0:02:01.320
So if I want to know a question to an answer, there's usually one best answer.

44
0:02:01.320 --> 0:02:03.120
We have 40,000 homes in Paris.

45
0:02:03.120 --> 0:02:05.880
There is no best home in Paris for anybody in this room.

46
0:02:05.880 --> 0:02:10.440
So we have to be really, really great at matching people and technology.

47
0:02:10.440 --> 0:02:13.520
We have to be a company that's just another example.

48
0:02:13.520 --> 0:02:15.760
Facebook, for example, is a digital product.

49
0:02:15.760 --> 0:02:17.600
Their product is their website.

50
0:02:17.600 --> 0:02:20.920
Our product are these experiences you have in the real world.

51
0:02:20.920 --> 0:02:22.240
So we're not just an online product.

52
0:02:22.240 --> 0:02:23.440
We have to be an offline product.

53
0:02:23.440 --> 0:02:27.360
And we need to transition from when you're at in your app through cities.

54
0:02:27.360 --> 0:02:31.120
And these are just some of the examples why technology, design.

55
0:02:31.120 --> 0:02:35.040
So basically the long and the short of it is we have to be real class of technology.

56
0:02:35.040 --> 0:02:37.000
We have to be real class of design.

57
0:02:37.000 --> 0:02:40.240
We have to be real class at branding because we've got to convince people this

58
0:02:40.240 --> 0:02:42.520
isn't crazy, you're not going to die when you use it.

59
0:02:42.520 --> 0:02:44.760
We have to convince governments this is good for your neighborhood.

60
0:02:44.760 --> 0:02:46.360
What happens the internet moves into your neighborhood?

61
0:02:46.360 --> 0:02:47.720
That's what people call it.

62
0:02:47.720 --> 0:02:49.080
It's a good thing, hopefully.

63
0:02:49.080 --> 0:02:50.480
And you've got to make sure trust and

64
0:02:50.480 --> 0:02:53.080
safety is really real class, that we handle all these payments and

65
0:02:53.080 --> 0:02:54.720
not have problems with risk.

66
0:02:54.720 --> 0:02:55.920
And I can kind of go through.

67
0:02:55.920 --> 0:02:57.600
And this is not even to do with culture.

68
0:02:57.600 --> 0:02:59.280
I didn't even mention culture.

69
0:02:59.280 --> 0:03:02.000
So that's how I describe it, I think great companies or

70
0:03:02.000 --> 0:03:04.120
companies are probably really strong at everything.

71
0:03:04.120 --> 0:03:07.520
But we try to hire the very best engineers and

72
0:03:07.520 --> 0:03:08.800
technical talent in the world and

73
0:03:08.800 --> 0:03:11.120
I definitely don't see it as a marketing company.

74
0:03:11.120 --> 0:03:11.800
Thank you.

75
0:03:11.800 --> 0:03:12.320
Thank you guys.

76
0:03:12.320 --> 0:03:22.320
Thank you.
